## üìö What You'll Find Here

This repository is structured to provide a clear learning path, with code examples, explanations, and projects organized into different levels of complexity.

### 1. Basics of Image Processing
- Fundamental concepts: pixels, color spaces (RGB, HSV), and image formats.  
- Core operations: resizing, cropping, and rotation.  
- Image filtering: blurring, sharpening, and edge detection using popular filters like Sobel and Canny.  

### 2. Intermediate Computer Vision
- Feature detection and matching (e.g., **SIFT, ORB**).  
- Object tracking techniques.  
- Geometric transformations and image stitching.  
- Classic computer vision algorithms for tasks like **face detection**.  

### 3. Advanced Deep Learning for Computer Vision
- Introduction to **Neural Networks** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.  
- State-of-the-art models for **Object Detection** (e.g., YOLO, Faster R-CNN).  
- **Semantic segmentation** and **instance segmentation**.  
- Exploring **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** and other modern architectures.
